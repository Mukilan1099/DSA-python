#Problem 3: Find the Middle Element of the Linked List

#Detect a Cycle in a Linked List
#Write a function to detect if there is a cycle in a linked list. A cycle occurs when a node's next pointer points back to a previous node, creating a loop. If thereâ€™s a cycle, return True; otherwise, return False.
